# Hi there 👋

#### My name is Enzo, I'm a postbac student 🏫 in my first year, specializing in math, physics and engineering science ! 👨‍🔬 I also have a great passion for programming so here is my GitHub 😄

### My personal projects 

I was able to realize many projects, small things in video games, management applications or animations. But they are not on this GitHub anymore! 
At the moment I'm working with a friend (@Adridri24), on a programming language! 

# My Skills

### Java
  
![](https://img.icons8.com/color/50/000000/java-coffee-cup-logo.png)  I started programming in the Java language at the beginning of middle school in order to create my first prototypes. 

### C++

![](https://img.icons8.com/color/50/000000/c-plus-plus-logo.png) Later, at the beginning of high school, I gave up Java to make way for C++ and create my development environment and tools. I don't claim to be an expert, but I think I acquired a good level.
