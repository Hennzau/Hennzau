<h2 align="center"> :student: Personnal Projects </h2>

I was able to realize many projects, small things in video games, management applications or animations. But they are not on this GitHub anymore! 
At the moment I'm studying mathematics and physics at Sainte-Genevi√®ve prep-school in Versailles so I have less time to spend on programming.

Currently thinking about : 
  - home made desktop-app builder based on ECS architecture: [HnZ](https://github.com/Hennzau/hnz)
  - home made windowing: [HnZ-Window](https://github.com/Hennzau/hnz-window)

Since I'm studying a lot, I use the [reMarkable Tablet](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2) to get organize. However I've not found a tool that can be used to save all your notebooks in PDF while recreating folder's tree structure. So I made a little tool: [rMCpp](https://github.com/Hennzau/rmcpp) to do this. It's really dirty and it works only for me **but** in the future I'll improve it.
