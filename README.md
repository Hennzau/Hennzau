# My Skills
### Languages
  
![](https://img.icons8.com/color/50/000000/java-coffee-cup-logo.png)  I started programming with the Java language at the beginning of middle school in order to create my first prototypes. 
![s](https://img.icons8.com/color/50/000000/c-plus-plus-logo.png) Later, at the beginning of high school I gave up Java to make way for C++ and create my development environment and tools. I don't claim to be an expert but I think I have acquired a good level.
